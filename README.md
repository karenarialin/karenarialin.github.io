#Welcome to the portfolio website of Karen Lin! 
##What a journey it was to build it. 

You can find it [here](karenarialin.github.io). 

Structure & tools: Jekyll + Github Pages + CloudFlare

###Phase 1:

Design process: did wireframes with pen and paper, designed logo

Debated between multi-page and single-scroll layout. Decided on multi-page. 

At first, I struggled along with pure HTML/CSS/Javascript and Github Pages. But I felt like I was writing repetitive code in the headers and footers. The images were loading slowly. The design was lackluster and the colors clashed.

I was also getting some bad scores from Google Page Speed. Error messages: leverage caching, blocking script.

###Phase 2: 

I did more research and got feedback from friends before coming up with my current design. 

I searched for ways to speed up the loading time and "leverage caching," as Google told me to do. That's when I discovered Jekyll, the static site generator that went along so nicely with Github Pages. After more research, I found CloudFlare, a Content Delivery Network that promised speed and security for free. Wow! 

It felt like my site was reborn.

Deployed!

###Phase 3:

The site still loaded my footer background picture slowly, so it was time to talk about mobile responsiveness, analytics, and browser caching. Fun stuff! Things people can't see but are just important.

Mobile responsiveness: got rid of padding on left and right, used wrapper 75%-80%. Still looks unattractive, but at least it works. Finished without making too many media queries. 



##To-do enhancements:
1. Restructure Work page so that it uses separate html pages for each section, instead of divs.
