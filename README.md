#Welcome to the portfolio website of Karen Lin! 
##What a journey it was to build it. 

Structure & tools: Jekyll + Github Pages + CloudFlare

###Phase 1:

Design process: did wireframes with pen and paper, designed logo

Debated between multi-page and single-scroll layout. Decided on multi-page. 

At first, I struggled along with pure HTML/CSS/Javascript and Github Pages. But I felt like I was writing repetitive code in the headers and footers. The images were loading slowly. The design was lackluster and the colors clashed.

I was also getting some bad scores from Google Page Speed. Error messages: leverage caching, blocking script.

###Phase 2: 

I did more research and got feedback from friends before coming up with my current design. 

I searched for ways to speed up the loading time and "leverage caching," as Google told me to do. That's when I discovered Jekyll, the static site generator that went along so nicely with Github Pages. After more research, I found CloudFlare, a Content Delivery Network that promised speed and security for free. Wow! 

It felt like my site was reborn.


To-do enhancements:
1. Restructure Work page so that it uses separate html pages for each section, instead of divs.
