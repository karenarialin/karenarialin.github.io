            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>I regularly publish articles on my blog.</p>
            <h2>Daily Cal</h2>
            <p>I wrote articles and opinion columns at The Daily Californian, UC Berkeley's student-run newspaper.</p>
            <h2>The Black Sheep</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, my articles are no longer online after The Black Sheep redesigned its website. However, I'm not too sad that all evidence of my slightly embarrassing foray into college humor writing is no longer accessible on the Internet. For samples of my satirical articles, feel free to email me at karenarialin@gmail.com.</p>

            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>Check out my code at <a href='#'>Github</a>.</p>
            <h2>Ranking Script</h2>
            <p>I love making  lists and ranking items. Using Shell sort (my favorite sorting algorithm), I wrote a Python script that presents users....I'm still in the process of turning it into a web application.</p>
            <h2>Snap--Below the Line</h2>
            <p>As a novice to programming, I helped develop an enhancement to the Snap! programming language, which was in JavaScript. Along with a partner, I developed a feature to detect the user's browser language and automatically refresh the page with the correct translation.</p>

        <div id='video' class='work-section'>
            <h2>The Daily Californian</h2>
            
            <p>I worked for two years as a videojournalist and editor at the Daily Californian, Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper. I covered everything from protests to art gallery openings to hackathons.</p>

            <p>Highlights:</p>
<p><a href='#'>Students block Sather Gate to protest police brutality</a>- A controversial video that went viral on Reddit and garnered 600,000+ views</p>
<p><a href='#'>Cal Band, the "Spirit of California"</a>- This video takes a look at the important role Cal's marching band plays in school spirit on campus</p>
            <p>I also contributed footage to several videos at the Irish Independent while I was a Multimedia intern there.</p>

        <div id='music' class='work-section'>
            <h2>Music Composition/Performance</h2>
            <p>Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I'm mainly a classical percussionist, but I've also dabbled in piano, flute, saxophone, French Horn, guitar, gamelan, and erhu.</p>
            <p>I've performed in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, choirs, percussion ensembles, gamelan ensembles, and instrumental bands.</p>
            <p>Some of my weirder instruments: flower pots, baking pans.</p>
            <p>I love music so much, I started writing my own pieces.</p>
            <p>As a member and officer of UC Berkeley's Undergraduate Composers Club, I composed and performed several original compositions. In the clips below, I am performing on marimba. </p>
            <p><a href='#'>Ringtone</a></p>
            <p>Composed and performed by Karen Lin</p>
            <p><a href='#'>Quiet Night Thoughts</a>- a classical Chinese poem set to music</p>
<p>Composed by Karen Lin</p>
            <p>Performed by Ziming Li, Drew Zagieboylo, and Yvonne Lau</p>
<a href='#'>Caverna Virtual</a>
            <p>Composed by Eric Delgado</p>
    <p>Performed by Karen Lin</p>
            
            <h2>The Mozaic Project</h2>

<p>I formed an instrumental pop trio with pianist Donald Chen and violinist Michael Hwang. We recorded YouTube videos and played live shows at Sliver Pizzeria. I performed with a variety of percussion instruments, including cajon, tambourine, glockenspiel, and more.</p>
