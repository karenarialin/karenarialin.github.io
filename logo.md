As soon as I started working on the website, I knew I needed a personal logo. Armed with my pen and notebook, I sketched out ideas that represented my interests, identity, and heritage.

Two pages of noodling later, I found my final design. It was a simple and subtle "K" that combined part of the character written in a Western font with part of the Chinese symbol for “water.” Perfect for an Asian American.

To my delight, it was versatile enough to place in other settings. In the music logo variation, the K resembles the alto clef symbol that is used in viola sheet music. The music notes are at the “A” and “E” position to represent the vowels in my name.

Other variations touch upon other parts of my life, like my spirit animal or my love for writing. I used the different logo variations to create a pattern.

Finally, I put together a basic graphic that summarizes my thoughts behind the logo.
