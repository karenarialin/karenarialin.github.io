    <p>I worked for two years as a <a href='http://www.dailycal.org/author/karenlin/' class='obvious-links'>multimedia journalist and editor</a> at The Daily Californian, Berkeley's independent student-run newspaper. I covered everything from protests to art gallery openings to hackathons.</p>

    <p><h3>Students block Sather Gate to protest police brutality</h3></p>

    <h2>Irish Independent</h2>
    <p><a href='http://www.independent.ie/' class='obvious-links'>Irish Independent</a> is one of the largest newspapers in Ireland. I contributed footage, graphics, and writing for various projects while I was a Multimedia intern there.</p>
    <strong><p>Highlights:</p></strong>
    <p><a href='http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/watch-dublin-buskers-meet-the-street-musicians-on-grafton-street-31395878.html' class='obvious-links'>Meet the street musicians on Grafton Street</a></p>
    <p>To put together this package, I wandered the streets of Dublin, conducting interviews with a fellow intern and collecting b-roll footage. Back in the newsroom, I edited the video and wrote an article to accompany it.</p>
    <p><a href='http://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-tv/travel-tv-how-to-beat-the-crowds-in-barcelona-31429396.html' class='obvious-links'>Travel TV: How to Beat the Crowds in Barcelona</a></p>
    <p>I shot footage of beautiful Barcelona during a weekend trip there to help travel reporter Pól Ó Conghaile create this feature about the famous tourist crowds.</p>
