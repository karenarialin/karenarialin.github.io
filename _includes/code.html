    <h2>Ranker</h2>
    <p>I love making lists and ranking items, so I wrote a program that would help me do both. The program compares all the items in a user-inputted list using the Shell sort algorithm (my favorite), then displays the final ranked list. I'm still in the process of turning it into a web application.</p>

    <h2>Snap--Below the Line</h2>
    <p>As a novice to programming, I helped develop an enhancement to the Snap! programming language in JavaScript. My partner and I designed a feature to detect the user's browser language and automatically refresh the Snap! webpage with the correct translation.</p>
