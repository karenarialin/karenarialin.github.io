        <h2>Engineering Words, Designing Music</h2>
        <img src='css/images/writing-logo.gif' class='work-logo'>
        <p>As a <strong>writer</strong>, I build clear, cohesive narratives that entertain, educate, and inspire. My writing approach helps me tell stories through many creative platforms.</p>
        <img src='css/images/design-logo.gif' class='work-logo'>
        <p>Like writing, <strong>design</strong> is the art of discovering the most creative and practical way to guide people through workflows and thought processes, especially when there's no right answer.</p>
        <img src='css/images/code-logo.gif' class='work-logo'>
        <p>Treating <strong>code</strong> like a story with logical, sequential order helps me focus on the needs of human users. I'm also a stickler for documentation.</p>
        <img src='css/images/video-logo.gif' class='work-logo'>
        <p>I shoot and edit <strong>video</strong> the same way I write, painting a cohesive picture and making sure transitions flow smoothly. Video is especially thrilling because it weaves together layers of narratives: sounds, visuals, and motion.</p>
        <img src='css/images/music-logo.gif' class='work-logo'>
        <p><strong>Music</strong> ties people together so powerfully. As a composer and performer, I use it to express my emotions for the enjoyment of others.</p>
