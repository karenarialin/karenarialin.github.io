The idea came to me when I was trying to decide what my five favorite college classes were. I looked online for an app that would allow me to compare two items on my list at a time and choose which one to rank higher on my list. But all the apps I found on the web sorted items automatically by numbers or letters.

So I wrote a script in Python to accomplish my goal, using my favorite sorting algorithm, the Shell Sort, as the backbone. Then I sought advice from programmer friends on how to turn it into a web app. One advised me to write it in JavaScript for security reasons.

I chose ReactJS as my framework. But before I could write a single line of code, I had to start with design.

Here are some initial sketches and wireframes.
